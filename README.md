This project was developed as part of a code-along project for the "Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp" course on Udemy. 

I learned a ton during this project, including fundamental and advanced backend development concepts, practical implementation skills, and best practices.

Special thanks to the course instructor for providing comprehensive materials and guidance.
